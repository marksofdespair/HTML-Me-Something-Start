               <p>I've been around professional coders since I was first brought home, because my dad is one. I talk about him
               a lot because I'm proud of him and respect him as a professional, but he's also the reason I'm here. One of
               my earliest core memories I have is of him taking me to an office he used to work at, and introducing me to
               some of his coworkers. I was only around 4 years of age. They had a candy drawer for tough days, and I got to 
               pick a piece of candy out. It was a 'sweet' introduction - but it was also when I first became interested in 
               what he did!

               <p>Later, he moved on from working with code, and currently works as a kubernetes
                  specialist, specializing in CI/CD pipelines and infastructure and a senior cloud engineer. He started doing things
                  I'm doing, and moved up because he worked hard and never stopped learning, and that is the core of being a
                  developer and engineer. It's something I aspire to, even if I don't stay in coding forever- always learning
                  is always admirable.

            <section>
               <p>He's been an indispensable resource, always happy to answer my questions and explain topics and concepts
                  that I might be confused on, or lacking understanding. So I'd like his story to be the start of my story in my
                  journey as a programmer. I'm truthfully not entirely sure what my trajectory is when it comes to my career,
                  but I do know I'll have a lot of guidance in whatever I choose to do.

         <section>
            <p>Currently, I don't have any specifics. I'd like to make a career out of this, but there are a dozen and a half
               niches and specializations and careers you can go into if you know how to code - it's daunting! So for now,
               instead of looking too far into the future and overwhelming myself, I'd like to just focus on learning as much
               as I can, and remembering to pace myself. I know me, and I know me gets easily overwhelmed and then shuts down.
               I dont want to miss the little details while looking at the big picture, so I'll try and find a nice middle-ground
               for now!
