      <p>I've been around professional coders since I was first brought home, because my dad is one. I talk about him
         a lot because I'm proud of him and respect him as a professional, but he's also the reason I'm here. One of
         my earliest core memories I have is of him taking me to an office he used to work at, and introducing me to
         some of his coworkers. They had a candy drawer for tough days, and I got to pick a piece of candy out.
      </p>

      <p>Later, he moved on from working with python and java to javascript, and currently works as a kubernetes
         consultant specializing in CI/CD pipelines and infastructure and senior cloud engineer. He started doing things
         I'm doing, and moved up because he worked hard and never stopped learning, and that is the core of being a
         developer and engineer. It's something I aspire to, even if I don't stay in coding forever- always learning
         is always admirable.
      </p>

      <p>He's been an indispensable resource, always happy to answer my questions and explain topics and concepts
         that I might be confused on, or lacking understanding. So I'd like his story to be the start of my story in my
         journey as a programmer. I'm truthfully not entirely sure what my trajectory is when it comes to my career,
         but I do know I'll have a lot of guidance in whatever I chose to do.
