               <p>I've been around professional coders since I was first brought home, because my dad is one. I talk about him
               a lot because I'm proud of him and respect him as a professional, but he's also the reason I'm here. One of
               my earliest core memories I have is of him taking me to an office he used to work at, and introducing me to
               some of his coworkers. I was only around 4 years of age. They had a candy drawer for tough days, and I got to 
               pick a piece of candy out. It was a 'sweet' introduction - but it was also when I first became interested in 
               what he did!

               <p>Later, he moved on from working with code, and currently works as a kubernetes
                  specialist, specializing in CI/CD pipelines and infastructure and a senior cloud engineer. He started doing things
                  I'm doing, and moved up because he worked hard and never stopped learning, and that is the core of being a
                  developer and engineer. It's something I aspire to, even if I don't stay in coding forever- always learning
                  is always admirable.

            <section>
               <p>He's been an indispensable resource, always happy to answer my questions and explain topics and concepts
                  that I might be confused on, or lacking understanding. So I'd like his story to be the start of my story in my
                  journey as a programmer. I'm truthfully not entirely sure what my trajectory is when it comes to my career,
                  but I do know I'll have a lot of guidance in whatever I choose to do.

               <p>Growing up, I was always an animal lover! I've had many pets of many different species over the years,
               and loved and cared for all of them. When I was 6, I really wanted to be a vet. As I grew older, however, I realized-
               well, that's a lot of work. It wasn' that I wasn't willing to do the work, it was just VERY intimidating, and I
               wondered if maybe it wasn't realistic the older I got, so then I wanted to be a vet tech. However, starting in
               high school, I started growing more and more interested in coding. I learned about it off and on as a hobby, but
               never took classes or did anything with it beyond self teaching. When I graduated high school, I went to a
               technical school to become a vet tech. However, due to health related circumstances, I ended up
               dropping out of the programme.
               </p>
               
               <p class="funParagraph">To this day, animals and plants remain a great interest of mine. I train dogs as a hobby, and I currently
               care for 3 dogs and look after 32 VERY dramatic plants (8 of which are cuttings I'm in the process of
               propagating). Plants and animal care will always be my passion, and I think my ideal job would be something that would
               allow me to use my skills as a coder combined with my passion for animals, video games, or plants. Maybe all of the above,
               but that's wishful thinking!
